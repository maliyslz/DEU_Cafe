# DEU_Cafe
In this project, we create a cafe simulation using mutexes and semaphores. The scenario is this: Consumers come to the cafe and try to find an empty cash register to buy coffee. The cashiers take the order, prepare it, give it to the customer, and the customer leaves.
 # Output
 CUSTOMER 1 IS CREATED AFTER 3 SECONDS.
 CUSTOMER 1 GOES TO REGISTER 1.
 CUSTOMER 1 FINISHED BUYING FROM REGISTER 1 AFTER 5 SECONDS.
